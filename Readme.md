This repository contains a malware sample written in C, designed for educational and research purposes. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the key mechanisms and techniques that malicious software typically employs in real-world attacks.

Key Features/Techniques:
File manipulation: Demonstrates how malware can infect files or create, read, write, and delete files.
Process injection: Example of process injection techniques to hide or manipulate running processes.
Network communication: Shows how malware can establish remote connections, communicate with a command and control server, or exfiltrate data.
Persistence mechanisms: Demonstrates how malware can maintain persistence by modifying registry keys, using startup folders, etc.
Obfuscation: Includes simple techniques to evade detection, such as encoding strings or code obfuscation.
Keylogging/Screen capture: Simulates keylogging or capturing user activity (for educational purposes only).

Important Disclaimer:
This project is strictly for educational, ethical hacking, research, and cybersecurity awareness. It is intended to help developers, students, and researchers understand how malware works in a controlled environment. Do not use this code for malicious purposes.

Use this sample only in isolated, controlled environments (like virtual machines or sandboxes) to avoid unintended consequences. I'm not responsible for any misuse or damage caused by the code.




1. Compile and Run the sever.c file in linux i.e Kali Linux 
	use the code given below to compile:

	gcc server.c -o server
	
2. Now compile backdoor.c in Kali Linus ny using Mingw32 
 
	use the code given below to compile:
	i686-w64-mingw32-gcc -o malware.exe backdoor.c -lwsock32 -lwininet
By using this code it would create a exe file that runs on target's windows machine 

And you are ready to rock!
